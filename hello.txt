the goals that i am setting for myself in 2023






1. Payback slice loan

Total amount: 19696

Reasons for loan:

# 5000 rupees scam
 -> I have been scammed by a group of ladies for a part time job
    * I have been a dick head for accepting that offer even when I know that no genuine employer asks for
      money in exchange of a job
    => My faults :
                * Without any deliberate thinking I have given them money from slice 
                * without consulting any of my friends and family
                * Consuming extra than I can bite
                * I have also given them my aadhar card details
                * believing everyone
                * ladies weakness
                * Greed
                

# 9000 for Oneplus mobile screen
-> I have lost 9000 for my mobile screen
* My faults :
        => carelessness that I haven't used protection for my phone no screen guard and no quality back cover
        => no familiarity with my surroundings
        => No deliberate thinking
        => urgency to set things right
        => without consulting with my friends and family

* What could I have done differently
        => could have replaced my phone with my father which would equally run good
        => some cheap branded mobile screen but that would damage the quality as experienced with my previous 
            phone i.e realme
        => I should have bought a screen guard and  a back cover before hand the incident even though I lost 
            my previous phone similarly I didn't care to buy a screen guard for the phone 
            Reasons :
                    => My carelessness and negligence
                    => Even when I tried to buy one such thing that didn't fit my phone screen and I lost camera
                        quality with that product
                    => I should have searched for other shop 
                    => The cost of my carelessness is 8300 which would be saved if I bought a screen guard worth
                     300
                     => The ratio of the loss is 27.66 times when compared to the protection
        
* Learnings from this mistake
    -> always buy protection kits when you can afford them as prevention is better than cure
    -> always ask your parents the money as they would give you with no interest where as slice takes
       taxes
