The problem this project is solving is delivering a list of items to hostel students.



navbar - home,cart,login,my orders

list of items - [ samosa-10,book-20,pen-5,bajji -30,punugulu-10]

so the idea is to give the user the ability to order items from a list of given items and if the item is not available we will give the user the ability to add it to the list of items.


The delivery partner will deliver the items to respective users every evening at 6 pm and orders placed till 5:30 pm are only deliverable on the same day and any order placed after 
that time will be delivered the following day.


The delivery cost for each item is 10 % of the item.

index.html- home page i.e landing page



admin.html -for the admin to monitor the application and to view insights

so, there are three roles in the system that are customer, delivery partner,admin

so there should be a collection for storing user that also should contain a row for the role he is playing


the attributes of user are
-> userid
-> name
-> student id
-> room no
-> hostel
-> phone no
-> role
-> password that has to be hashed


Next the customer selects the items he wishes to be delivered to his room from the home page and add them to cart 

the attributes of item are
-> itemid
-> name
-> description
-> cost per item
-> isAvailable (whether the item is in stock or not)

Then he checks the items and places the order

the attirbutes of order are 
-> orderid
-> customerid
-> timestamp
-> items (this has to be the list of items he is placing the order)
-> total cost


now we need to design a signup page that takes all the details of the customer and entries it in the users collection
and we need to design a signin page .

we also need deliverypartner signin page and adimin signin page

for delivery partners it should show orders.html -for the delivery partner to look out for the orders placed before 5:30 pm

for admin he should be able to add items to the list and monitor the app


so for the basic prototype of the app we need following pages

landing page
signup page
signin page
home page
orders page for the customer to look out for the placed orders by him
admin page to add new items
deliverypartner page for looking for orders placed till 5:30 pm
